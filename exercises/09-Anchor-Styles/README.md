# `09` 3D Anchor Styles

The "background" CSS rule allows us to assign and work with the background of any container- the background can be a color or an image. If it is an image you can specify if you want the image to repeat horizontally, vertically, both, or not at all, and you can also specify if you want it to resize and fit the whole container where its being applied, among other properties that can be modified.

## üìù Instructions:

Run the exercise.
Change the background-size to "contain" (check the index.css tab).
Run the exercise again.
Change the background-repeat to inherit to make it repeat over the x axis and y axis.
Run the exercise again.
