# `01` Hello World

In this website, we have 2 elements: a H1 with the ID #theTitle and a paragraph with the ID #theParagraph.

You can select any of the objects in the DOM with the getElementById function. If we want to select the h1 paragraph and assign it to a variable, do the following:

```javascript
var aux = document.getElementById("theTitle");
```

Now that we have our h1 element stored in the aux variable, we can access any of the properties of the element, for example we can retrieve the font-size style property.

## üìù Instructions:

Prompt an alert with the ID of the h1.

Hint:

- Here you can read more about the id property of any DOM element: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_id.asp
