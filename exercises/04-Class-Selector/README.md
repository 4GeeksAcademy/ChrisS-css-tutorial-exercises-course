# `04` Class Selector

There are many ways to select HTML elements to apply styles to them, so far we have only use the `tag` selector, but there are others:

#### 1) `.class` Selector

The most popular css selector, you will use it every 5 minutes.
Use the class property of the HTML element to select it. Styling rules will apply to all elements with the same class value

```css
.small{
    font-size: 9px;
}
```
Note: any html tag with the `class="small"` will have a font-size of 9px.

#### 2) `#id` selector

```css
#small{
    font-size: 9px;
}
```
Use the id property of the HTML element to select it. IDs should be unique, only one element must have the same ID.
Note: The html tag with the `id="my_number_one"` will have a font-size of 9px.

# üìù Instructions:

Right now there is a class selected on the CSS that is called `.b-blue`.

Please apply that class to both of the `<p>` tags in HTML.
