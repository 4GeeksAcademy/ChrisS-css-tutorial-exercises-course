| `tag` selector | Use the tag name of the HTML element to select it, the styles will be applied to all elements with that tag |
| `.class` selector | Use the class property of the HTML element to select it. Styling rules will apply to all elements with the same class value |
| `#id` selector | Use the id property of the HTML element to select it. IDs should be unique, only one element must have the same ID. |
