# `07` Very Specific Rules

# **Important:**

In this exercise, you can add your code only above the **READ ONLY BLOCK** of the code, you can add as many lines as you want, but always above.

## üìù Instructions:

- Set the <ul> text color to red (override conflicts with specificity).
- Set the background color of the second <li> of the <ol> to green (don't use the #id selector).
- Make the odd rows of the tables with yellow background using **tr:nth-child**.
